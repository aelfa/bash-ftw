## Why I Made This

*The life of a developer.*

*Hopping from one terminal to the next VM over SSH.*  
*IT upgrades laptops for your whole department and you lose your precious customizations.*  
*Ubuntu here, Mac (FreeBSD) there, RedHat over there, Debian over yonder, Amazon Linux over there, ...*

*Years of muscle memory... What?! Do. You. Mean. `-bash: ll: command not found`?*  
*Handicapped, crippled*

`ssh me@somehost`  
`me@somehost's password:`

*Why. Isn't. It. Recognizing. My. Public. Key.*

`ssh -v me@somehost`  
`...`

*No more of this.*

## What's In the Box

* ~~TBD~~ It's good. I use it, and you should use it to. No time to write this `README` section.
